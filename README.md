This project uses the fruit 360 dataset by Horea Muresan, cofilab and other sources from the internet to train a two models. An Apple Checker Model to detect if a fruit is an apple and an Apple Grader Model to predict the grade of the image of an apple fruit. Together, these two models were used to develop an apple grading system using Tkinter. Both models where trained using the ResNet50 pretrained model.
